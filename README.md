# Mac-Shortcuts for Windows
TL;DR: Overwriting Windows default keyboard bindings for Mac keyboard

### Purpose:
I built a pc ages ago before starting a degree in CS. Before I went to college, I got a Macbook and 
since then have been using it for school. Turns out, I quite like the shortcuts and bindings that 
came with it out of the box. This essentially just overwrites the prexisting bindings so I dont have 
to think too hard when switching between operating systems. 

### Directions:
1. Download Autohotkey
2. Download script in repo
3. Put a shortcut of it into the Win+r “shell:startup” folder
4. Right-click the original file and choose "Open with" and then AutoKotkey as the default for ".ahk" files


# PowerToys, an addition to Mac-Shortcuts
TL;DR: Essentially just Mac's spotlight feature for Windows, if you can't beat em join em I suppose

### Directions:
1. Download powertoys
2. Click on PowerToys Run
3. Make sure the shortcut in the ".ahk" file is there for Windows+Space
